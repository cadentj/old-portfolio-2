### A Journey Into WebGL: Ship Scrolling Animation
- My first venture into three.js - an interface to deploy computer graphics to the brower using WebGL.
- Tinkered with some vector representations and created a space-travel effect.
- Death star textures were messed up on deployment to GH-Pages.
- [DEMO HERE](https://cadentj.github.io/starwars-cover/)
